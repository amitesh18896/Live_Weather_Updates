Live Weather Updates using Python

To get the live weather conditions of any city using Python,
you first have to install the BeautifulSoup library in Python. 
You can easily install this Python library in your system by using the pip command:


pip install beautifulsoup4

After installing this library, you can now start with this task by importing 
the necessary Python libraries that we need for this task.
After importing the libraries we need to scrape the weather
updates of a city by searching about it on Google


There are many ways to get live weather conditions for any city using the Python programming language. 
You can either use the weather APIs provided by third-party apps
or you can also scrape the live weather data from a particular city.


If you are using weather APIs provided by any platform,
you need to connect to their paid services to work with
the weather APIs. But if you use your web scraping skills, it will be free.


In the  code, we are searching for a city on Google,
and then we are scraping the data about that particular city concerning 
location, time, info, and weather.
After running the  Python code you will see an output as shown below.


Enter the Name of Any City >>  New Delhi
